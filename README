WHAT IS MOD_EVASIVE ?

mod_evasive is a module for the Apache HTTP Server to provide evasive
action in the event of a (D)DoS or brute force attack.

Detection is performed by storing objects containing IPs and URIs in a
global cache, and denying clients from any of the following:

- Requesting a distinct page over a configurable threshold within
  a defined interval.
- Requesting any page on a distinct site over a configurable threshold
  within a defined interval.
- Making any requests while being blocked.

HOW TO INSTALL

1. make

2. sudo make install

3. sudo systemctl restart apache2  # on Debian and derivatives

CONFIGURATION

The module has to be explicitly enabled per virtual host context with
DOSEnable. In addition, a Shared Object Cache must be specified using
DOSCache (and the relevant module must be enabled). The following excerpt
also shows the default values of the other directives, which are optional:

<VirtualHost *:*>
    DOSEnable           on
    DOSCache            shmcb
    DOSPageCount        2
    DOSSiteCount        50
    DOSPageInterval     1
    DOSSiteInterval     1
    DOSBlockingPeriod   10
</VirtualHost>

DOSPageCount
------------

This is the threshold for the number of requests for the same page (or URI)
per page interval.  Once the threshold for that interval has been exceeded,
the IP address of the client will be added to the blocking list.
 
DOSSiteCount
------------

This is the threshold for the total number of requests for any object by
the same client on the same listener per site interval.  Once the threshold
for that interval has been exceeded, the IP address of the client will be added
to the blocking list.

DOSPageInterval
---------------

The interval for the page count threshold in seconds.

DOSSiteInterval
---------------

The interval for the site count threshold in seconds.

DOSBlockingPeriod
-----------------

The blocking period is the amount of time (in seconds) that a client will be
blocked for if they are added to the blocking list.  During this time, all
subsequent requests from the client will result in a 429 (Too Many Requests) and
the timer being reset (e.g. another 10 seconds).  Since the timer is reset
for every subsequent request, it is not necessary to have a long blocking
period; in the event of a DoS attack, this timer will keep getting reset. 

DOSWhitelist
------------

IP addresses of trusted clients can be whitelisted to insure they are never 
denied.  The purpose of whitelisting is to protect software, scripts, local 
searchbots, or other automated tools from being denied for requesting large 
amounts of data from the server.  Whitelisting should *not* be used to add 
customer lists or anything of the sort, as this will open the server to abuse.
This module is very difficult to trigger without performing some type of 
malicious attack, and for that reason it is more appropriate to allow the 
module to decide on its own whether or not an individual customer should be 
blocked.

To whitelist an address (or range) add entries to the configuration in
the following fashion:

DOSWhitelist	127.0.0.1
DOSWhitelist	172.16.1.*

Wildcards '?' or '*' can be utilized. This directive may be issued up to
10 times.

TESTING

Want to make sure it's working? Run test.pl, and view the response codes.
It's best to run it several times on the same machine as the web server until
you get 429 (Too Many Requests) messages. Some larger servers with high child counts
may require more of a beating than smaller servers before blacklisting
addresses. 

Please don't use this script to DoS others without their permission.
